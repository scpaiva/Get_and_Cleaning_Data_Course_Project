The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:
Groups training and test sets into one data set.
Extract the measurements from the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and generate this new data set.
And it creates another data set containing only the averages of each variable for each activity and each participant in the new data set obtained previously.
