<p>The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Groups training and test sets into one data set.</li>
<li>Extract the measurements from the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and generate this new data set.</li>
<li>And it creates another data set containing only the averages of each variable for each activity and each participant in the new data set obtained previously.</li>
</ul>
